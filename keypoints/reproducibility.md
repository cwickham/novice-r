-   A structured and standard project folder and file layout
    is the first step to having a reproducible data analysis project.
-   Writing documents in R Markdown can reduce the time spent on manual tasks
    since results can be easily re-generated and inserted into the final document to improve reproducibility.
-   `usethis` has several helper functions for managing data analysis projects.
-   Following a style guide and emphasizing readable code can lead to better quality code
    and to code that is more likely to be reproducible and reusable.
-   Using Markdown to write documents is a great way to improve accessibility (since it is plain text only)
    and allows you to generate multiple types of output (HTML, PDF, slides, etc) from a single document source.
