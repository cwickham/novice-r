- Functions allow separating code into chunks that perform specific tasks.
They make code easier to write, read, troubleshoot, and reuse.
- Function arguments can have default values so that they don't have to be
set every time you call the function.
- When asking for help online, it is crucial that you include a minimal
reproducible example so that others can best evaluate your question and provide
the best answers possible for you.
- Packages makes it easy to reuse and share code in an organized and automated
manner. These can be installed with package managers.


- Assert statements can be used to explicitly check the truth value of
    a condition and halt code execution if needed.
